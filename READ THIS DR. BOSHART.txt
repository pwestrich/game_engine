Dr. Boshart,

Our game is on GitHub here: https://github.com/pwestrich/game_engine. The version
you should grade is marked 0.1.

All you ahve to do to run and build the game should be:

1. Change the PATH variable in the build_game.bat
2. Change the INC_DIRS in the Makefile
3. Change the LIB_DIRS in the Makefile
4. Run the batch script

If you have any problems grading it, let me know. I'll lend you my flash drive I've built it on.
