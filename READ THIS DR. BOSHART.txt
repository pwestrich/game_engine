Dr. Boshart,

My game is in the same place: https://github.com/pwestrich/game_engine.
This time, use version 0.2. It should compile just the same as the last did.

I don't own a joystick like yours, not could I find someone who owned one, so
I wasn't able to include any joystick inputs.

Instead, you get mouse and keyboard. Her's the controls:

Mouse movement rotates the camera.
Left click locks the camera in place. A second click will unlock it.
Right click resets the camera position.

W-S moves the camera along the Z-axis.
A-D moves the camera along the X-axis.
LSHIFT-SPACE moves the camera along the Y-axis.
TAB stops camera movement.

When moving the camera, hitting the key will accellerate the camera's movement in that direction,
i.e., if you tap W, the camera will start moving in the megative Z direction. Tapping S will stop it,
because it adds accelleration in the positive Z direction.

UPARROW-DOWNARROW moves the truck forwards and backwards, using the same scheme as moving the camera.
The camera will also follow the truck wherever it goes.
LEFTARROW-RIGHTARROW will turn the wheels 45 degrees left or right. The truck will start turning if it is moving.

Hopefully the controls aren't too confusing; I had a good idea for joystick input, but I found that the one 
I own won't work very well.

I think camera rotation gets a little messed up when you turn the truck; that's why you can reset the camera's location.
