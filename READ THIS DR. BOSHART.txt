Dr. Boshart,

My game is in the same place: https://github.com/pwestrich/game_engine.
This time, use version 0.3. It should compile just the same as the last did.

Like I said the other day, the controls are now in the GUI, and should be easy enough
to figure out. 
In the left GUI, the wheels are turned by the bottom left to right scroll bar, and the 
truck is moved by the left bar. Down is forward, up is backwards. Don't ask me why.
The three other buttons will stop the truck, straighten the wheels, and sound the horn.

The right GUI controls the camera. It doesn't work how I want it to, but it's close enough.
The X scroll bar rotates the camera up and down. The Y bar does left to right. There is a 
button to reset the cameara's position and direction too. The camera can be moved in the world 
by using WASD, LSHIFT and SPACE like in the last assignment too.

There is one special sound effect for you to find. I made it myself, just for you. 
Here's a hint: it's a keyboard button that's also the average grade you give on exams.

If you have any trouble building or running it, let me know. I'll lend you my flash drive.
