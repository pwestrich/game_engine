Dr. Boshart,

My game is in the same place: https://github.com/pwestrich/game_engine.
This time, use version 0.4. It should compile just the same as the last did.

Things added this time:

	* Heather and her models! (she's my partner now)
	* Physics! (finally fixed it)
	* Applying forces to things rather than teleporting them short distances!
	* Lots of scripting! (plan on even more later)
	* Multithreaded physics!
	* Convex hulls!

Turns out I was missing the part where I saved the new world transform. Whoops.
Falling though the world was fixed by making the ground substantially thicker.

You'll need all of the BulletMultithreaded libraries built and in your paths, libs, and 
include directories. If you have trouble building them, let me know.

You will run into a compiler bug of sorts. When building, the compiler will complain about
an _hypot() function in <math.h>. Simply remove the underscore from the function on the 
line it is complaining about, and that should fix it.

All input is performed by scripts that can be changed while the game is running. Makes for
a lot less compiling. As it stands, I believe all of the game content is completley seperate 
from the engine. Next, I plan on working on functions that return values (ran out of time
for that this time around) so that I can make scripts do much more complex things. Should 
make AI interesting.

Controls need some work; that'll be part of what we do for next assignment, since the 
majority of our time was spent moving all of Heather's models (she made a lot of them)
over to my project and fixing physics.

The game will take a while to load; it tkaes time calculating all those convex hulls. I'll 
consider saving them to disk in the future, or maybe actually using the btComplexShape next
time. You said my convex hulls would count as a complex shape, so you better not skimp out 
on the points!

If you have any trouble building or running it, let me know. I'll lend you my flash drive.
